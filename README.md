## About the Project

This project uses the Nucleo board and the Arduino multifunction shield to implement the following functionality:

### Real-Time Clock (RTC)

- After the board resets, the 7-segment display begins counting the elapsed time in minutes and seconds starting from zero.
  - The least two digits count the **seconds**.
  - The higher digits count the **minutes**.
- Pressing **switch S1** at any time restarts the clock from zero.

### Analog Signal Value Display

- The **on-board potentiometer** is used to generate a variable voltage input to the on-chip ADC.
- Pressing **switch S3**:
  - The 7-segment display shows the ADCâ€™s input voltage value in volts.
  - The RTC continues running in the background while S3 is pressed.
- Releasing **switch S3**:
  - The 7-segment display switches back to displaying time.

## Features

- Real-Time Clock (RTC) functionality with restart capability.
- Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC) for voltage measurement.
- Dynamic 7-segment display switching between time and voltage values.
- Seamless integration of hardware components via the Nucleo board and Arduino multifunction shield.

## Technologies Used

- **Mbed IDE** for embedded systems development.
- **Nucleo Board** as the microcontroller platform.
- **Arduino Multifunction Shield** for interfacing switches, potentiometer, and 7-segment display.

## Usage

1. Connect the Nucleo board with the Arduino multifunction shield.
2. Power on the board and observe the 7-segment display:
   - The display will start counting time from zero.
3. Interact with the system:
   - **Press S1**: Restart the clock.
   - **Press S3**: Display the ADC input voltage in volts.
   - **Release S3**: Switch back to displaying time.
